			<h2>Hello Everyone, my name is <em>Anthony</em></h2>
			<p>Welome to my webpage! 
			I am pursuing a Mathematics degree at the University of Buffalo 
			while simultaneously training as a Software Developer through YearUp. 
			On top of that, I am also a technology instructor at ScholarStem,
			where I guide students in exploring Virtual Reality and Scratch Jr. through classroom projects.</p>
			<p><br>From these experiences, 
			I have developed skills in problem-solving, effective classroom management, 
			and comprehension of both the front-end and back-end components of a software application.
			I am committed to continuously enhancing both my technical abilities and interpersonal skills. 
			Please explore the website. I ensure an engaging experience!</p>

			<h2>The Student</h2>
			<p>As I reflect on my studies at UB, 
			I have learned that authentic learning comes from a deep understanding of the material and its practical application in the real world. 
			Learning is a lifelong pursuit beyond the classroom and requires continuous effort and dedication.</p>
